## CATALAN WORD VECTORS. TRAINING AND ANALYSIS
This assignment consists on the creation, analysis and evaluation of word vectors, using a database created from Wikipedia articles. Word embeddings are a form of representations where each word is mapped to a numeric vector. They are key for many natural language processing systems, so it is essential to know how they work. The main ideas are that words with similar meaning should have similar vectors and the fact that the environment of a word gives meaning to it. In relation to this, the model we will use in this assignment takes into account the context words to make predictions. Specifically, we will train and improve a CBOW (Continuous bag-of-words) model and later on, analyze the word vectors generated. To do that, we will work on a Kaggle Environment, which allow us to share our work and our data and to have access to GPU resources.
